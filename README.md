# ❀floristream tones gallery

A simple responsive gallery using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without any external dependencies. The sample fotos are stored on Google Drive.
The gallery imports the fotos catalog from a CSV file. The CSV file has the following fields:

`RGB,ID,Label`

`RGB` is the tone color in hexadecimal format without the `#` symbol.  
`ID` is the unique file ID on Google Drive.  
`Label` is the text label for the current picture.  

For example:

```
FFF,id1,White color
800000,id2,Maroon color
```
